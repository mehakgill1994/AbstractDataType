# AbstractDataType
This assignment is done as part of the course "Advanced Programming in C++". In this assignment, I created a 2x2 matrix as an abstract data type. I have also overloaded all the operators to perform all the operations on this abstract data type as if you are dealing with any inbuilt data type of standard C++ library.
